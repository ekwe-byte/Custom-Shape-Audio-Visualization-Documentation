#2.2 - Bar Config

`Bar Width`: The thickness of each visualizer bar.

`Bar Height (Scale Y)`: The master sensitivity for bar height. Increases the influence of audio volume on the length of the bars.

`Min Bar Height`: The minimum length of a bar, ensuring they don't disappear completely during silence.

`Max Bar Height`: The maximum limit for bar length, preventing them from extending too far.

`Enable Scale X`: If enabled, bar width will dynamically scale with the audio volume.

`Scale X`: Controls the intensity of width changes in response to volume.

`Min / Max Bar Width`: Constraints for the dynamic width scaling.

`Bar Angle Offset`: Rotates the bars relative to the shape's surface.

`Bar Alignment`: Controls the growth direction of the bars relative to the shape path.
+ `Center`: The bar grows in both directions from the shape's line *(default)*.
+ `Inward`: The bar grows into the shape.
+ `Outward`: The bar grows out of the shape.

`Multiplier Bars`: Adjusts the density of the visualizer by multiplying the number of generated bars.

`Audio Buffer / Number of Bars`: The resolution of the audio spectrum. Determines the base number of bars.
