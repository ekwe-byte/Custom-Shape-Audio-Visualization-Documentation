# 2.7 - Parallax

`Camera Parallax`: Enable parallax effect compatibility
> ⚠️ Only check this if your wallpaper itself has camera parallax enabled and you want this visualizer to be part of that effect. This may cause the wrong `Circle Size`.

`Parallax Depth X / Y`: Controls how much the visualizer moves with your mouse.
